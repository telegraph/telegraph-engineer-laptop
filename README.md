# Laptop development setup script
Sets up a newly imaged Mac for development, quickly using 
common tools/apps used at the Telegraph


## CAUTION

WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!

## Laptop

Telegraph-engineer-laptop is a script to set up an macOS laptop/desktop for web and 
mobile development. 

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages based on what is already installed 
on the machine.

## Note
* This script *must* be run under the developers account and *not* the TMG admin account 
as customisations are based on the developer "user" setup on the machine

* Developers requiring XCode must install XCode from the App store, which requires logging in to the App store

Important scripts and files -
* **bin/*.sh**: Scripts that will be run, depending on OS and can be used for customising your build
* **config/settings: Configuration for github, and your machine (assuming is has not been setup by yourself)

## Remember 

* PLEASE!! Look over the scripts before running - you might not like the affects
* Use as is if you find this suitable, otherwise customise as needed.


## Installation

Clone the repo to a location on your machine

	git clone git://github.com/telegraph/telegraph-engineer-laptop.git ~/laptop 
	cd ~/laptop 

Rename (or copy) {USER}.local to *YOUR* user name. ie. bobs.local
      
      mv {USER}.local bobs.local
      
Edit the config/settings file to add your github credentials.  If your machine has not been
cloned by your systems admin, and you want to use this to setup your machine, uncomment the 
machine settings and edit to your liking

Run the main script (make sure you read it first.)

      ./mac

1. mac - this will setup the default applications needed by most developers, using homebrew
1. {USER}.local - this is where you add your customisations 
 

Please pay attention when running the scripts - you will be prompted for 
* your root credentials - these are needed to install some components
* your Git credentials 

## Requirements

## Customize via `~/laptop/{USER}.local`

Your `~/laptop/{USER}.local` is run at the end of the Laptop script.
Remember to rename/copy {USER}.local to *YOUR* username.local (ie bobs.local)
Put your customizations there, and refer to bin/*.* for useful scripts that
can be included to enhance your customisation
Refer to {USER}.local for examples:

Note: Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `mac` script for examples.

The example file provides the following

* [ASDF] for managing programming language versions
* [Node.js] and [NPM], for running apps and installing JavaScript packages
* [Yarn] for managing JavaScript packages

[ImageMagick]: http://www.imagemagick.org/
[Node.js]: http://nodejs.org/
[NPM]: https://www.npmjs.org/
[ASDF]: https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf
[Yarn]: https://yarnpkg.com/en/

It should take about 90 minutes to install (depends on your machine and internet connection).


## To Do Improvements
1. Change the install to require curl to install the basic script rather than
requiring git.  This would require a re-run to include customisations if the 
user wanted them - a good reason to the script and localisations can be re-run
safely.
1. Add some CI and testing - this cannot be run in a Docker container as it is
 mac specific.
1. Consider adding "type" specific environment.  For example, have an AEM dev for 
AEM dev tools, one for mobile specific dev tools, etc.
